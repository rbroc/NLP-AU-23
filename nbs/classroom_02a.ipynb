    "## Introduction to SpaCy\n",
    "SpaCy is one of the main libraries for NLP in Python. It is especially tailored towards the (development and) deployment of pipelines for a number of NLP tasks, from named entity recognition to dependency parsing. Recent additions to spaCy also make it possible to use advanced models (LLMs) as building block for such pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some of SpaCy's basic functionality. As we will mainly focus on understanding and implementing methods to represent and generate text, we will not be using SpaCy extensively for the rest of the course -- but it is a great tool for many applications, and it has wonderful documentation.\n",
